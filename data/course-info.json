        "details": "CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.",

        "details": "Tailwind CSS is a low-level framework. Meaning, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesn’t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components. For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site.",

It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.",

It breaks down complex UIs into small, isolated code called “components”. By using these components, React only concerns itself with what you see on the front page of a website.Developed by Facebook in 2011, React has quickly become one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries. According to HackerRank, 30% of employers look for developers who know React but only about half of the applicants actually have the required knowledge. Clearly, React is in high demand in the job market.",

Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that were not chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it.[1] They founded Firebase as a separate company in 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012.",
